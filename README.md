##### Intro

The goal of this tool is to provide an easy to manipulate todo.txt files in such a way that one can define task dependencies (tasks that must be completed before others can be executed).

It was also a toy project I started in order to learn the Rust programming language (so, don't expect beautiful, idiomatic code).

I want to add the ability to add and remove tasks from the task list, but as for now, most of what you can do is to display the tasks in a nicely format table in your terminal, and mark tasks as completed. The rest can be done by simply editing your task file in your favourite text editor.


##### Installation

Make sure you have Rust installed. Just follow the instructions here: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html

Clone the repo and run it using ```cargo run``` or just compile it into an executable using ```cargo build --release``.
